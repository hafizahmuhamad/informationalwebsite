<p>Kelantan is familiar with local name which is Kijang.  Kelantan's history goes back in time quite a bit, with settlements found here which date to the prehistoric times. The early history of Kelantan has links with the Khmer Empire, Funan Kingdom, Sri Vijaya, Siam and Majapahit. During the 15th century, Kelantan's ruler, Raja Kumar, got his independence from Siam and this area was quite an important trade centre at the time.

<p>Kelantan has gone on to become vassals for the Sumatran Sri Vijaya Empire and the Siamese. Kelantan was known from earlier times as a seat of powerful kingdoms that established trading links with the Chinese Empire which referred to
Kelantan as Ho-Lo-Tan

<p>In the second part of the 18th century, a Patani warlord called Long Yunus managed to unify the Kelantan area. In 1800, his son succeeded him and his name was Long Muhammad, but ruled under the name Sultan Muhammad I. When this ruler died without having any kids, a civil war broke out, for control over the throne. The winner was a nephew of his, which managed to win in 1835, when he became Sultan Muhammad II. He had an alliance made with Siam, which allowed him to create a Kelantan state which had a basis in Kota Bharu.

<p>In 1909, a treat between the Siamese and the English was signed and the Thais gave up any claims they had over a number of territories, including Perlis, Kedah, Terengganu and Kelantan. In the end Kelantan became one of the states of Malay and it had a British Adviser.

<p>The Japanese invaded this province first when they came to Malaya, in 1941, on December 8. Kelantan was ruled by Siam once again while it was occupied by the Japanese but it was taken back by the British when Japan was defeated.

<p>In 1948, on February 1st, Kelantan entered the Malaya Federation. In 1957, on August 31, these states got their independence. In 1963 Kelantan became a Malaysian state.
