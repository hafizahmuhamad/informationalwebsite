<strong><li>History</li></strong> <p>Kelantan is located in the north-eastern corner of the peninsula. 
Kelantan, which is said to translate as the "Land of Lightning", is an agrarian state with green paddy fields, rustic fishing villages and casuarina-lined beaches.</p><br>
<strong><li>Geography</li></strong>
<p>Gunung Korbu which is located in Kelantan is the second highest peak in Peninsular Malaysia. From Kuala Krai the conjoined streams become the Kelantan River, a broad, mud-coloured stream which dominates the fertile coastal plains and defines the geography of the region. The Kelantan River valley is a fertile rice-bowl, rich in hardwoods and rubber and lush with tropical fruits.</p><br>
<strong><li>Economy</li></strong>
<p>Kelantan has a chiefly agrarian economy dominated by rice, rubber and tobacco. Fishing is also one of the important economic activity. Kelantan is famous for cottage industries which employ traditional skills in handicraft production such as batik, woodcarving and songket weaving. Logging activities are active given the vast remaining area of forest. In recent years, tourism of Kelantan has increased especially to offshore islands. A few reputable hotels have been established and more modern shopping malls have been opened to cater for urban folks.</p><br>
<strong><li>Political Background</li></strong>
<p>Kelantan has been ruled by the Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS) since 1990. It is currently one of three Malaysian states ruled by PAS after the 2018 elections, the other being Terengganu and Kedah. Almost all PAS members are Malay Muslims, as are about 95% of Kelantan's population.</p><br>
